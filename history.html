                        <p>During the Unified Silla period, hanbok began incorporating influences from Tang Dynasty China, developing more sophisticated silhouettes and decorative elements that reflected social status.</p>

                        <h3>Mongolian Influence</h3>
                        <p>The Goryeo dynasty saw significant changes in hanbok design due to Mongol influence. Clothing became more form-fitting, and new accessories like the 'gache' (ornamental hairpiece) were introduced.</p>

                        <p>The Joseon Dynasty marked the peak of hanbok development. The characteristic high-waisted chima and shortened jeogori emerged, along with strict regulations governing colors and designs based on social class.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Hanbok embodies the Korean aesthetic principle of "자연미" (natural beauty), emphasizing harmony between human and nature through its flowing lines and natural colors.</p>
                <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The curved lines of the jeogori represent the heavens, while the straight lines of the chima represent the earth, reflecting the Korean cosmological worldview.</p>
                <p><strong>Social Function:</strong> Historically, hanbok served as a visual indicator of social status, marital status, and age, with specific colors and patterns reserved for different classes and occasions.</p>
                <p><strong>Modern Legacy:</strong> Today, hanbok is worn during important celebrations like weddings, holidays (설날, 추석), and cultural festivals, maintaining its role as a symbol of Korean identity and heritage.</p>
